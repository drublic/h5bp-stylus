# [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) - Stylus

## About this Project
I use HTML5Boilerplate a lot and love to use [Stylus](learnboost.github.com/stylus/) in my projects for styling. So I decided to put up this project to merge all the latest changes of the H5BP's styles in this Stylus file.

Reusing classes (like `.clearfix`) with `@extend` (which landed in Stylus some weeks ago) will be pretty easy now.

Furthermore there are some variables which will make customizing colors and stuff a bit easier.


## About H5BP
