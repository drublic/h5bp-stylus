# [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) - Stylus

## About this Project
I use HTML5Boilerplate a lot and love to use [Stylus](learnboost.github.com/stylus/) in my projects for styling. So I decided to put up this project to merge all the latest changes of the HTML5 Boilerplates's styles in this Stylus file.

Reusing classes (like `.clearfix`) with `@extend` will be pretty easy now.

Furthermore there are some variables which will make customizing colors and stuff a bit easier.


## About HTML5 Boilerplate
HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template that helps you build fast, robust, adaptable, and future-proof websites. Spend more time developing and less time reinventing the wheel.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
